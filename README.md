!&# Panels
==========

This module takes excellent work from [Panopoly](http://drupal.org/project/panopoly) and combines it into a single optional module.

* Pane previews
* Override view mode of node rows in view content panes.
* UI improvements for pane settings: grouping of fields, relabeling, autocomplete filter
  on node titles.
* Use view modes in entity template suggestions.
* All of Panopoly's layout plugins.
* A broken accordion (bad implementation uses JS to move title out of pane into region,
  see [Panels Tabs](http://drupalcode.org/project/panels_tabs.git/tree/refs/heads/7.x-1.x)
  for a better way).
* Contextual links to edit an entity's fields and its view mode display settings.
* No markup is default on all new panel displays and panes.
